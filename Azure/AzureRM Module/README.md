#Azure-PS-Scripts

Written in : PowerShell,
Module : AzureRM (Note: Az PowerShell modules now have all the capabilities of AzureRM PowerShell modules and more, hence Microsoft will retire AzureRM PowerShell modules on 29 February 2024. New and Old scripts should be migrated to Az Modules),

Important : The Author claims no responsibility if running the scripts creates issue in the Infrastructure.
If you have a Test Environment, Recommendation is to run and test it over there first.
